<p>Trust in and rely confidently on the LORD with all your heart and do not rely on your own insight or understanding. In all your ways know and acknowledge and recognize Him, and He will make your paths straight and smooth [removing obstacles that block your way]. Proverbs 3:5-6 (AMP)

Do you believe that God wants to be involved in every part of your life? According to Proverbs, life works best when we invite Him into the details of our lives and recognize God in every single thing we do. </p>

<h1 class="video"> Sausages in the test</h1>  
<p>I have asked many of you what you find to be the most challenging part of meal planning, and many of you said you get stuck in a rut eating the same things. I hope that my weekly meal plan inspires you to get creative and think outside the box when cooking for your family!
Here is a little bit of an overview on how I meal prep for the week:
Breakfasts: I tend to eat the same type of thing for breakfast. I usually make a batch of something with several servings for Sean and I have for breakfast meals before workouts. We then have a shake or another quick meal afterwards. On Saturdays, we tend to have a more sit-down type of meal instead of two smaller meals.
Lunches: If I know I am having a very busy day, I try to plan for crockpot meals early in the morning, so the meal is ready to go by lunch, or I plan for a quick 15-minute recipe. Having leftovers always makes things easier as I can use it for lunches and dinners later in the week.
Dinners: I tend to make a meal for dinner that Sean and I that will have leftovers for at least one other night in the week. Then I rotate other quick meals in too. I don't include Sunday since we are usually gone most of the day with Church activities and/or eating with family. We also try to do a date night every other week or so.
Katie's money saving tip: If you make the Apple Pie Turnovers, you can freeze unused egg roll wrappers for use another time. Alternatively, you could make several batches of the turnovers and freeze the them after baking. Thaw in the microwave when you are ready to enjoy!
Snacks and Desserts: Ideas of things I rotate often are listed at the very bottom, and are always varying based on hunger levels, activity level, etc. Also, please note, I don't meal plan in order to track calories or to stick to a set diet. Meal planning to me is all about having a set plan in place for my meals so that I am prepared, feel organized, and to save time and money during the busyness of the week. If I am hungry beyond what is listed, I listen to my body and eat intuitively! This is simply a guide for meals that I know I will be making for the week, not necessarily everything I will eat in a day.
